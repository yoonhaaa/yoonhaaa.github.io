                <p>Currently, our society acquires and utilizes new information through the media. However, the development of media is followed by the development and spread of fake news.</p>
                <p>In fact, in 2016, the Oxford Dictionary selected "post-truth" as the word of the world, diagnosing that post-truth is a characteristic of an era in which post-truth appears worldwide. Fake news is now a social controversy, as evidenced by the beginning of the era of post-truth. Fake news is false information that is deliberately distributed in the form of media reports for political and economic benefits. Maybe you also got a lot of 'fake news' in the early days of the COVID pandemic. Since the COVID pandemic, many people have trembled with anxiety, resulting in fake news that has resulted in another bout of anxiety. The world was filled with distrust of vaccines and governments, which played a major role in fake news.</p>
                <p>To counter fake news, we need to develop 'media literacy'. Media literacy is the ability to understand media information, analyze, evaluate, and communicate messages. In order for us to understand media properly, we need to know how to distinguish whether media information is true or false, useful or harmful. In a society where the importance of media has grown, we must develop media literacy and know how to distinguish fake news.</p>

                <h3>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</h3>
                <p class="by line">Published by Yoonha on 9, 30, 2023</p>
                <p>Do you think you can get addicted to drugs even before birth? Maybe you don't want to hear the answer 'you can get addicted'. But we must accept the reality that even newborns can become addicted to drugs. The U.S., which is suffering from fentanyl abuse, is also currently experiencing "Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome."</p>
                <p>Neonatal withdrawal syndrome is a phenomenon in which when a pregnant woman takes drugs such as fentanyl, the fetus is also addicted to the drug. The fetus shows diarrhea, high fever, and vomiting with severe tremors before even seeing the light of the world properly. The fentanyl crisis poses a risk even to unborn children.</p>
                <p>The seriousness of this phenomenon can be recognized just by the existence of a medical facility in Phoenix, Arizona, USA that specializes in managing neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Newborn babies with withdrawal syndrome tend to crave the darkness and stillness of the uterus. At the medical facility, special attention is paid to maintaining a certain degree of darkness while blocking bright light and noise. It is also equipped with Narcan, an emergency drug detoxifier, which was originally a prescription drug that police and emergency services could administer to drug addicts</p>
                <p>Since March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has decided that it can be purchased without a doctor's prescription. That's how serious the drug addiction situation in the United States has become.</p>
                <p>We must accept this terrible reality and seek ways to overcome the tragedy.</p>

                <h3>War on drugs</h3>
                <p class="by line">Published by Yoonha on 9, 22, 2023</p>
                <p>It is no secret that drug abuse in the United States is severe. Then what about the domestic situation? All the recent domestic news says South Korea is no longer a drug-free country. In fact, about 40 teenagers who took fentanyl were caught by the police in May 2020. This is because fentanyl is easy to get. It has become very easy to access fentanyl by going to the hospital and asking for fentanyl for painkillers, reselling that fentanyl, and buying and selling lists of hospitals that easily give fentanyl.</p>
                <p>The world is now at war on drugs. Global efforts to solve this problem are urgently needed. Recently, portable drug diagnostic kits are being made to prevent unknowingly ingesting drugs. It is hoped that science and technology will be applied in various ways to help overcome the social crisis of "war on drugs."</p>

                <h3>Strength of Chinese social media</h3>
                <p class="by line">Published by Yoonha on 9, 15, 2023</p>
                <p>In China, global services such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter are banned under Chinese government policies. Nevertheless, the Chinese online user population accounts for 20% of the global online user population. This is due to the growth of China's IT giants and the birth of China's own social media.</p>
                <p>The most frequently used messenger app in China is "WeChat." It is different with other messenger apps on the platform. First of all, various contents provided by the others can be used through separate apps. On the other hand, the contents provided by Tencent, a company of WeChat, can be used through a "mini program" within WeChat without downloading a separate app. In terms of convenience, China's WeChat is ahead.</p>
                <p>Recently, short-form content, a very short video of about 15 seconds, is the trend, as it is suitable for busy modern people to have fun while saving time. In fact, TikTok made in China is the start of Short-form content. TikTok spread around the world, while YouTube produced its own short-form content with "Shorts" and Instagram with "Reels."</p>
                <p>The strength of social media in China is that it understands the features of modern people who like convenience and efficiency and uses them appropriately. It is incredible that it has created content that has captivated people around the world in a closed atmosphere.</p>

                <h3>Online stabbing threats in Korea</h3>
                <p class="by line">Published by Yoonha on 9, 12, 2023</p>
                <p>This summer, South Korea had scary days. This was all due to ‘online stabbing threats.’</p>
                <p>After a series of stabbing at Silim Station in Seoul City, and Seohyeon Station in Seongnam City, dozens of ‘online stabbing threats’ were posted, raising social confusion. The arrested people said it was “a joke” and claimed that they did not intend to actually commit the crime.</p>
                <p>Experts analyzed that they post a notice because of causing fear in an unspecified number of people and when they have a strong desire to obtain psychological compensation or imitate a knife rampage. That is, they caricature violent crimes and enjoy people’s reactions in order to receive a large amount of attention.</p>
                <p>As the notice of murder continues, lots of people argue that it should be judged to be equivalent to terrorism and punishment should be strengthened. In fact, some violent crimes, such as murder, can be charged from the preliminary and conspiracy stages.</p>
                <p>In order to resolve the situation that has thrown the entire nation into chaos and ease public fear, it is necessary to revise the anri-terrorism law to strengthen punishment.</p>

                <h3>Climate crisis and the role of the press</h3>
                <p class="by line">Published by Yoonha on 9, 2, 2023</p>
                <p>Do you think the press takes responsibility and acts accordingly? I don’t think so. The movie “Don’t Look Up” is one of the best examples of it. In the movie, the press didn't seriously deal with scientists' warnings and eventually the Earth collapsed. In fact, this is not just a movie anymore.</p>
                <p>According to the Digital News Report 2022 announced by the Reuters Journalism Institute, 42% of people worldwide are interested in climate change news. It shows that people's interest is low compared to the seriousness of the climate crisis. One of these reasons is climate silence, which refers to the lukewarm response of the press without paying much attention to the climate crisis.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, the world's press is trying to solve this problem. Journalists in France have announced a 'journalism charter to respond to the environmental and climate crisis'. The Guardian, the British media outlet, has announced that it will not advertise for fossil fuel companies. In addition, the press specializing in the environment are increasing around the world, such as Grist in the United States and Vert in France. Above all, "Covering Climate Now(CCNow)" was created, involving more than 500 press from the globe.</p>
                <p>However, there are still many media that are not responsible. The press does not just deliver news; it also makes the reader realize something. That is why the press should deal with the climate crisis seriously, and why I feel sorry for this situation.</p>
